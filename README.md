# MOO InDesign extension script

## Hello!

If you're a MOO customer who uses Adobe InDesign, you may find this
extension script useful. It allows you to create MiniCards, Business
Cards and PostCards and upload them to MOO, all from within InDesign.

## Compatibility

The script has been tested with CS5 and CS5.5. Earlier versions will
not work (yet).

It has also only been tested on a Mac, but should work on Windows too.

## Installation

* Download moo.jsx
* Copy it to your Mac, in `/Applications/Adobe InDesign CS5/Scripts/startup scripts`
* Start InDesign (CS5 or higher)
* There should be a MOO menu!

## Usage

The MOO menu should be fairly self-explanatory. It allows you to

* create a new product (MiniCard, Business Card or Post Card)
* add sides
* change whether those sides are _details_ or _image_ (or _front_ or _back_, if you prefer!)
* send your finished design to MOO, where you can check it over before adding it your cart.
